# AI-Voice-Assistant
This code is for a simple AI assistant that can recognize voice commands and perform tasks such as searching on Google, opening websites like YouTube, Instagram, Facebook, and Twitter, playing music on YouTube using the pywhatkit module, and speaking out the search results using the pyttsx3 module. The code uses the speech_recognition module to recognize voice commands, and the pyautogui module to simulate mouse and keyboard actions. The recognize_speech function initializes the speech recognizer and microphone, sets the energy threshold and ambient noise adjustment, listens for audio input, and returns the recognized text. The speak function initializes the text-to-speech engine, speaks the given text, and runs the engine. The main function uses a while loop to continuously listen for voice commands, recognizes the commands using the recognize_speech function, and performs the corresponding task using if-else statements. If the recognized command contains "samrat", it checks for specific keywords like "search", "play music", "youtube", "instagram", "facebook", "twitter", and "exit" to perform the corresponding task. The main function uses the webbrowser module to open URLs in the default web browser and the time module to pause for a few seconds before performing certain actions.
